This is project for Face Mask Detection with Deep Sort

This uses Yolo v3 to detect person, then uses deep sort to track person and counts people crossing the middle line.
use the link to download remaining trained models. https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgnWcfMSYWdeafTxCRBlBcpiACA?e=jd5y9D

Run the project by starting main.py after all dependencies and all files have been downloaded and unzipped in the root directory.
